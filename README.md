# Strategy Pattern Example: Online Payment Processing

## Introduction

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable. In this example, it is applied to an online payment processing scenario where customers can choose different payment methods, such as credit cards, PayPal, or Google Pay.

## Real-world Analogy

In the context of an e-commerce application, the Strategy Pattern acts as the conductor of payment methods, offering customers various payment options like credit cards, PayPal, and Google Pay. Each payment method encapsulates its unique processing logic while conforming to a unified interface, allowing seamless selection and execution of different payment strategies.

## Components

### Strategy Interface (IPaymentStrategy)

- Defines the interface for payment strategies.
- Contains a method, such as `ProcessPayment`, which encapsulates the algorithm for processing a payment.

### Concrete Strategies (CreditCardPaymentStrategy, PayPalPaymentStrategy, etc.)

- Implement the `IPaymentStrategy` interface with their specific payment processing algorithms.
- Each concrete strategy encapsulates the logic for a particular payment method.

### Context Class (PaymentProcessor)

- Contains a reference to the selected payment strategy.
- Utilizes the selected strategy to process payments.

## Usage

1. Instantiate the desired payment strategy objects (e.g., `CreditCardPaymentStrategy`, `PayPalPaymentStrategy`).
2. Create a `PaymentProcessor` instance, passing the desired strategy.
3. Use the `ProcessPayment()` method of the `PaymentProcessor` to execute payment processing.

## Implementation Notes

- Facilitate easy addition of new payment methods by implementing new concrete strategies without modifying existing code.
- Ensure each payment strategy conforms to the defined strategy interface to maintain interchangeability.
